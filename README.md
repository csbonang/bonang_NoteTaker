## Description
The note taker program allows the user to create, save, and delete notes. When the user opens the Note Taker application, they are presented with a landing page. The landing page includes a link to the notes page. Upon clicking the link, the note page displays icon buttons that represents/executes its primary tasks of either saving, creating, or deleting. A link at the top-left corner leads back to the landing page.
